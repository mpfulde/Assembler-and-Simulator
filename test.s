; test program that counts up to 255
;
start:  not r0 r1
        and r0 r0 r1    ; value and its complement are zero
        not r1 r0       ; r1 contains 255
        add r1 r1 r1    ; r1 contains 254
        not r1 r1       ; not 254 = 1
loop:   and r3 r0 r0    ; r3 now has zero
        add r0 r0 r1    ; increment by 1
        bnz 62        ; repeat until r0=256=0
        and r3 r3 r3    ; and r3 with itself to set flags
stop:   bnz stop        ; r3 is never zero, effectively stop
